The name of the legendary Lionel Messi is unheard by none. The little magician has won everything there is to win in club football and is exceptional on the individual front as well. His achievements include 3 UEFA Champions League titles (UCL), 6 LaLiga titles, 3 Golden Boots, 4 Ballon D'ORs (all four of which he won in a row) to name a few. Setting new records everytime he sets foot on the pitch. His goalscoring exploits include 50 goals in a single Liga campaign, 68 goals in all of the UCL campaigns combined and his remarkable record of 2012 of 91 goals in a calendar year.

But this year we might not see that kind of Messi. In his first few performances of the season it is quite clear that he is being played in a deeper role by new FC Barcelona manager Luis Enrique. This is to get the best out of his play-making abilities. But that wouldn't be a problem for La Pulga as he has always had that playmaker within him, apart from scoring countless goals throughout the past seasons, Messi has also been assisting a lot. He is second to none in europe in the past 5 seasons in terms of assists and his deeper role is just to get the best out of that ability. It is logical as well now with Suarez and Neymar in the team, they have someone who can finish - taking some pressure of Messi. Messi earlier had the ultra - difficult task of assisting his team-mates as well as being the primary finisher of the team. For Messi individual award winning is not anymore a priority, he has broken every record and won everything on the individual front. His main priority is winning titles with the team.

This seems to be a very delicious prospect for FC Barcelona with Messi being the link between the midfield and attack, Suarez - the current best out and out striker in the world and Neymar in attack. In this, they probably have the best attack trio in world football. We'll see as this season continues to progress.
